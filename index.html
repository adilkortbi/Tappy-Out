  <h2>– Tailored to Your Specific Needs</h2>
  
  <p>
    Are you a business owner? A tradesperson? A creator or designer?<br>
    If so, you need an Area Business Card to promote your services and connect with your customers and clients.
  </p>

  <h2>– Just a Tap Away</h2>
  
  <p>
    • Paper business cards are a recurring expense.<br>
    • They don’t support a green economy.<br>
    • They’re often discarded or forgotten.<br><br>
    These are just a few reasons why paper business cards are outdated.<br><br>
    Of course, if your business doesn’t provide a service or trade, you may not need physical marketing tools like posters or cards—regardless of the material.<br><br>
    But if you're a professional—painter, artist, barber, craftsman, nail technician, beautician… you name it—<br>
    You need a digital business card!
  </p>

  <p>
    With our card, you can instantly share your website, social media profiles, shop location, payment links, and more—just with a tap.
