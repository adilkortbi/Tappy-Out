Project and Page Goals Overview

Overall Website Goal:
Create an interactive, user-friendly platform where customers can browse and customize business cards, manage their selections in a shopping cart, and easily place orders, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Home Page / Main Page:
Introduce the business concept and provide navigation links to customize cards and view the cart.

Customise Card Section:
Display available business card designs with images, names, prices, and quantity selectors. Allow users to upload custom logos and add personal links for unique card customization.

Shopping Cart Section:
Show all selected card items with real-time updates on quantities, pricing, and previews. Enable adding/removing items dynamically, and summarize the order before checkout.

Checkout Process:
Enable users to review their order summary and proceed to checkout, which triggers a mailto link containing the order details to place the order via email.

Order Confirmation / Success Page (planned):
Inform users of successful order placement or provide feedback on failures (can be added as per Stripe checkout integration).
